What is ELK stack ?

ELK stack consists of 3 components namely,
E => Elasticsearch (highly scalable search index server)
L => Logstash (Tool for collection, enrichment, filtering, and forwarding of data)
K => Kibana (Tool for exploration and visualization of data)


Steps :

1. Download the ELK stack from their official website 
2. Unzip the files and folders to extract the app and get started
3. Start the elasticsearch server using the .bat file
4. We should be able to see JSON data about our server cluster
5. After that perform same steps for both kibana and logstash
6. Add a csv file for the dashboard building e.g (NewYork Airbnb Data) and create a logstash.conf file for it
7. Then create the dashboard on Kibana based on the sample data
